  * Helped build and test one of the detector upgrades proposed for the second phase of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) Beam Energy Scan (BES). It is designed such that when a minimum ionizing particle (MIP) hits one of the optically-isolated tiles of this detector, which are made of special plastic material, photons are generated through scintillation. The photons then travel through a wavelength-shifting fiber embedded in the tile to a clear optical fiber to be detected by silicon photo-multipliers.

  * Helped build two test stands that use cosmic rays and a radioactive source to quantify the quality and uniformity of the detector. sectors.
  * Connected different electronics boards to each other and to silicon photomultipliers to digitize the signals detected.
  * Performed different calculations, such as the distance an electron from the radioactive source can travel through different materials before stopping.
  * Analyzed data collected from both tests using ROOT.
