# About Me

Born and raised in Syria, my family and I fled to Lebanon in 2012 due to the Syrian Civil War. After graduating high school in Lebanon, I moved to the U.S., where I'm currently seeking asylum.

I'm a first-year physics Ph.D. student at Stanford University. I recently joined the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) group, led by Prof. Chao-Lin Kuo at the Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology (KIPAC) at Stanford. I currently work on modeling polarized galactic dust emission, which is the dominant polarized CMB foreground at large angular scales and high frequencies. In my free time, I work with a couple of colleagues at KIPAC on developing machine learning models for enhancing cosmological simulations.
