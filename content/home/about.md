# About Me

Born and raised in Syria, my family and I fled to Lebanon in 2012 due to the Syrian Civil War. After graduating high school in Lebanon, I moved to the U.S., where I'm currently seeking asylum.

I am a first-year physics Ph.D. student at Stanford University. I recently joined the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) group at the Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology (KIPAC) at Stanford after a few research rotations with different groups. I currently work with Prof. Chao-Lin Kuo and Prof. Susan Clark on modeling polarized galactic dust emission, which is the dominant CMB foreground at large angular scales and high frequencies. Removing the dust's contribution from our CMB measurements helps us better identify patterns of primordial gravitational waves, which, if detected, would confirm the highly successful but unproven theory of inflation, a period of exponential expansion of space in the early universe.

I'm also finishing up a project with a couple of colleagues at KIPAC, developing a machine learning model for enhancing cosmological simulations.
