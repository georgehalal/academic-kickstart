# Biography

Born and raised in Syria, my family and I moved to Lebanon in 2012 due to the Syrian Civil War. After graduating high school in Lebanon, I moved to the U.S. for college and my family moved to Dubai, UAE. I am now an undergraduate senior at Lehigh University, majoring in physics and minoring in applied mathematics. I use machine learning techniques (a form of artificial intelligence) to analyze data coming from ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions to better understand the strong force (Quantum Chromodynamics). I plan on pursuing a Ph.D. in Experimental High Energy Physics upon graduation and eventually working as a professor at a research university.
