# About Me

Born and raised in Syria, my family and I moved to Lebanon in 2012 due to the Syrian Civil War. After graduating high school in Lebanon, I moved to the U.S. for college, and my parents moved to Dubai, UAE, where they currently live. I am currently a first-year physics Ph.D. student at Stanford University, working with Dr. Daniel Gruen and Prof. Risa Wechsler at the Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology (KIPAC) at Stanford. I use machine learning and other data science techniques to develop new statistical methods for enhancing cosmological measurements.
