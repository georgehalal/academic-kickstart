# About Me

Born and raised in Syria, my family and I moved to Lebanon in 2012 due to the Syrian Civil War. After graduating high school in Lebanon, I moved to the U.S. for college, and my family moved to Dubai, UAE. I currently use machine learning techniques, a form of artificial intelligence, to analyze data from ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions at the STAR experiment at RHIC. I also previously aided in building, testing, and analyzing the performance of one of the detector upgrades for STAR among other projects. In June 2019, I will be attending Stanford University to pursue my PhD in physics. I hope to eventually work as a professor at a research university.
