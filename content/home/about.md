# About Me

Born and raised in Syria, my family and I moved to Lebanon in 2012 due to the Syrian Civil War. After graduating high school in Lebanon, I moved to the U.S. for college, and my family moved to Dubai, UAE. I am currently a rising first-year physics Ph.D. student at Stanford University, and I hope to eventually work as a professor at a research university.

I started my physics Ph.D. in June 2019 with a summer research rotation, working with Prof. Giorgio Gratta on detector R&D for the nEXO experiment to search for neutrinoless double beta decay as well as developing machine learning techniques for searching for specific decays. Prior to that, I used machine learning techniques at Yale University to analyze data from ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions at the STAR experiment at RHIC, which turned into part of my senior thesis. I also previously aided in building, testing, and analyzing the performance of one of the detectors for STAR among other projects listed in my CV.
