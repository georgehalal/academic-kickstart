# About Me

Born and raised in Syria, my family and I moved to Lebanon in 2012 due to the Syrian Civil War. After graduating high school in Lebanon, I moved to the U.S. for college, and my family moved to Dubai, UAE. I currently use machine learning techniques, a form of artificial intelligence, to analyze data from ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions at the STAR experiment at RHIC. I also previously aided in building, testing, and analyzing the performance of one of the detector upgrades for STAR among other projects listed in my CV on the left. In June 2019, I will be attending Stanford University to pursue my PhD in physics. I hope to eventually work as a professor at a research university.
