# About Me

Born and raised in Syria, my family and I fled to Lebanon in 2012 due to the Syrian Civil War. After graduating high school in Lebanon, I moved to the U.S., where I'm currently seeking asylum.

I am a second-year physics Ph.D. student at Stanford University. I am co-advised by Prof. Chao-Lin Kuo and Prof. Susan Clark at the Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology (KIPAC) at Stanford. I work on modeling polarized Galactic dust emission, which is the dominant Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) foreground at high frequencies. Removing the dust's contribution from our CMB measurements helps us better identify patterns of primordial gravitational waves, which, if detected, would confirm the highly successful but unproven theory of inflation, a period of exponential expansion of space in the early universe.
