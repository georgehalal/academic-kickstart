  Advisors: Helen Caines & John Harris
  
  * Simulated proton-proton and heavy-ion collisions at RHIC energies, clustered final state particles into jets, and added detector effects.
  * Trained a neural network model made of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers and fully-connected layers using Keras and scikit-learn on a list of discriminators to be able to classify charm, bottom, and light jets.
  * Developed a new jet tagging strategy for RHIC.

  * Trained an artificial neural network to identify the centrality of a collision, based on which of the detector tiles are hit during a given collision.
  * Trained another network to identify the $2^{nd}$ order event plane of a collision by minimizing the difference between the event planes measured by the east and west detectors.

  * Analyzed data collected by the eighth of the detector that was installed for the RHIC 2017 run, colliding protons at √s = 510 GeV and gold ions at √sNN = 54.4 GeV, to optimize its final design.
  * Compared it to the other detectors at the STAR experiment to verify that they are measuring the same collisions at the same time and that the electronics work properly.
  * Analyzed the charged particle multiplicity distribution in the detector as a function of pseudorapidity and compared it to the results from the RHIC PHOBOS experiment and to Monte Carlo simulations.
  * Studied the ADC distributions of the tiles in the detector to quantify the number of minimum ionizing particles (MIP) hitting the detector.
  * Studied whether it is useful to have a maximum ADC cap for each tile in the EPD in order to suppress the effects of large Landau fluctuations and what that value should be.
